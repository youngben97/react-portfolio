                        Hello! I am a web developer based in Salt Lake City, UT.
                        I have experience working with HTML, CSS, JS, SQL/Sequelize, MongoDB/Mongoose,
                        Express, Node, and most recently, React.

                        In my free time I like to read, cook, and get involved
                        in my local theatre community.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div className='row p-2'>
                <img className='col-lg-4'></img>
                //add an image
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
